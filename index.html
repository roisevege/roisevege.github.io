	<h2 class = "title">About</h2>
	<p> Iâ€˜m a Phd candidate of computer science in the <a href = "http://www.soic.indiana.edu/index.html">School of Informatics and Computing</a> at <a href = "https://www.indiana.edu/">Indiana University Bloomington</a>. At IUB, my interests lie in information retrievel, statistical learning and complex systems. I recently join in <a href = "http://cnets.indiana.edu/groups/nan/">Networks & agents Network group</a>, and luckily study under the supervising of <a href = "http://cnets.indiana.edu/people/filippo-menczer/">Fillipo Menczer</a>. And I am also working with <a href = "http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~djcran/">David Crandall</a> and <a href = "http://www.normsu.com/">Norman Su</a>.</p>
	<p> Before IUB, I got my B.E. in Jiangnan University and worked in geometry reconstruction with professor Yi Lin. <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/pub/wen-chen/b7/4a8/b3b">You may find more about my professional experience at Linkedin...</a></p>

				<p>I am a 100% Asian comic and animation fan. Actually, I studied in digital media in my college, and learnt a lot about animation(model, storyboard, film and etc.). I always wish I could find my works in degital media back, but they were gone when my old laptop crashed. I also make some Gundam models though I am not a Gundam Series fan.</p>
				<p>I spent most of my vacations into traveling. While I am always amazed by diverse culture and beauty of nature worldwide, I generally notice people, regardless of nationality and culture background, do have similar emotional resonance,moral values and life pursuits. I plan to upload my photographs to <a href = "https://instagram.com/calibeef/">Instagram</a> gradually.

				<p> <strong>Great Minds Think Alike</strong> is a mobile game with the purpose of semantic data collection. We intend to build a free source of giant semantic data base by this game. The users of the game will build the semantic web unaware. I am responsible to develop the game.
				</p>
				<p> <strong> Web Evolvments</strong> is a tool to detect the design periods of a website in its history, using computer vision algorithms. We hope this tool can help HCI researchers to study the web design patterns and design genre changes.
				</p> 
				<p>I also have some course works going on. For example, I am trying to find the structure and dimension of Youtube user and group communities. You can see my <a href = "https://github.com/roisevege/data_visualization_Youtube/blob/master/Midterm%20project.ipynb">interim report</a> if interested. I am developing interactive networks for this topic using D3.</p>
